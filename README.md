User gives a size threshold, scripts walk a directory and deletes file that are equally or exceed the threshold

it's in test "mode" for avoiding accidental deletion --> just prints the files that are about to be deleted.
check the output message and if you are ok with which are about to be deleted then open the script in editor
and uncomment the lines  no. 56 and 60
